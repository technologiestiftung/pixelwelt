# CityLAB Pixelwelt 

This map shows the CityLAB Berlin as a pixel world and is mentioned to be its digital twin.
The map is based on the starter kit of [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

**To visit the map and chat with others follow the [Link to the CityLAB Pixelwelt](https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/technologiestiftung.github.io/pixelwelt/map.json)**

## Getting Started
In order to build the **CityLAB Pixelwelt**, we used the WorkAdventure Starter Kit. Just visited their [Github Repository](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure-map-starter-kit) and clicked the green **"Use this template"** button to the top right.

**Advantage:** WorkAdventure provides a web-server to serve your map (this starter kit proposes to use Github static pages as a web-server which is both free and performant) and to serve a Jitsi-Server. 

**Disdavantage:** Only up to 15 concurrent users are for free

## How to contribute

1. Install the [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software on your computer
2. Read the [documentation of the Tiled editor](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/) in order to navigate properly
3. Gather "tiles" aka. `png-images` to create your map. You can already find some tiles in the `tiles folder`. You can also create your own custom tiles if you like. Be aware: one tile has to have exatcly the size of **32x32px**
5. Open the `map.js` in the tiled editor and change things you'd like to change
6. Save the map und push the new version to GitHub

Push on master automatically triggers a new deploy on GitHub pages (takes some minutes).
